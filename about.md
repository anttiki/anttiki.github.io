My name is Antti Kirjavainen. 

I'm a co-founder of [Flowa](https://www.flowa.fi/), a coach, collaboration gardener and a human being.

I'm into:

* role-playing games (big into Blades in the Dark and its hacks at the moment),
* board games (From Cthulhu Mythos co-op games to short games like Century: Spice Road to social deduction games like Secret Hitler),
* computer games (although not as much as I used to in the days of Atari and C-64),
* improv,
* tv series (The Expanse!),
* books (genre books mostly, but other stuff as well),
* movies (from superhero romps to indie films),
* physical culture (bodyweight, kettlebells, biking, silly dance moves etc.)
* nature (seaside, lakes, national parks)
* etc.

Surprisingly long list, wow. And that's some of the stuff I'll be writing about here.

You can contact me through Twitter or from [Flowa](https://www.flowa.fi/)'s pages.
