This post continues my list of the top 5 games I played in 2024. The idea for this series comes from the excellent [Eggplant Podcast.](https://eggplant.show/)

By the way, I left out any TTRPG sessions or campaigns I’ve run to keep things simple.

## 1. *Miami Vice* TTRPG – Season 3 (Final Season)

Our *Miami Vice* tabletop RPG campaign, which began in fall 2022, reached its conclusion this fall. I played James “Sonny” Crockett, alongside other characters from the iconic team: detectives Gina Navarro Calabrese, Trudy Joplin, and Ricardo Tubbs.

### Props and Supporting Characters

Our GM’s meticulous use of props elevated the experience to new heights. Check out the game table setup in the photo below.

Another standout feature of our game was the inclusion of guest players portraying supporting characters. At one point, when our detective team split up, we took turns playing side characters for a session or two—an innovative twist that kept things engaging.  

### Better Than the TV Show  

Unlike the original series, the game delved into authentic Miami history, incorporating events and details whose significance often only became clear later.  

The player characters were well-written and developed deeper dimensions as the campaign progressed. And let’s not forget my amazing co-players, who are absolute gems!

As we celebrated the final session of the season, I realized how much Crockett’s character had influenced me throughout the campaign.  

For all these reasons, the third season of *Miami Vice* takes the top spot in my 2024 gaming highlights.

### From the Past to the Future  

After wrapping up, we kicked off an *Alien USCMC* campaign with the same group. Expectations are sky-high after two sessions—stay tuned, as this will probably make next year’s top 5 list!

## Honorable Mention: [Etiäinen RPG Podcast](https://etiainenpodcast.wordpress.com/podcast/)

We launched the [*Etiäinen* podcast](https://etiainenpodcast.wordpress.com/podcast/) in December 2023. I was surprised to be invited to join the podcast as a player, but it’s been an amazing experience. Over the past year, we’ve released 35+ episodes and even performed live at Ropecon. And we’ve had so much fun along the way!  

Our podcast has grown and evolved thanks to my fantastic co-players, especially Petri and Exo/ELF. A big shoutout also to Cafe Boardgame for providing recording spaces.

*Etiäinen* has found its own small but passionate audience this year, and don’t worry—it’s not going anywhere in 2025!
