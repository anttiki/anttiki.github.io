title: Dreamspace, anyone?
---

Yesterday evening I was browsing my book shelf for some light reading and I ended up pulling Hillfolk, Robin D. Laws' game of iron age drama (a role-playing game).

Laws' DramaSystem is intriguing for me, even though it seems to be quite system-heavy judging from how it reads to me.

But, there was another thing in the book that really caught my attention: an alternate setting, Dreamspace by Keith Baker.

# Dreamspace setting pitch

Let me quote the pitch in a nutshell:

> Lost in the universal unconscious, the crew of the dreamship Endymion searches for reality.

It is set in a universe where dreamships are the only way to travel between worlds.

> There's no way to travel faster than light. But it is possible to cheat space by taking a shortcut through a dimension that has no concept of physical distance: the universal unconscious, the linked dreams of all living beings.

What's not to like? Here are some concepts I find intriguing:

* The reason for the crew to cross dreams is search for profit
* To travel in Dreamspace you need a pilot who is sleeping through the whole journey
* In all worlds, there are Sleeping Beauties, whose endless dreams serve as stepping stones for journeys
* The whole journey is influenced by the pilot's unconsciousness as the vessel is wrapped in the dreams of the pilot
* the members of the crew have different motivations for being there
* the game starts with a bang: something has gone wrong and the vessel is lost in the collective uncosnciousness â€“ how can the crew save themselves and who is to blame?

# let's give it a spin?

I'm seriously thinking about trying this out in practice. Maybe online, as things are how they are right now.

Are you interested? Give me a shout!
